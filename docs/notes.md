Incremental Approach: having sorted A[1..j-1], insert A[j] into the proper place
Divide and Conquer: 
* Divide the problem into a number of subproblems that are smaller instances of the same problem
* Conquer the subproblems by solving them recursively
* Combine the solutions to the subproblems into the solutions for the original problem
